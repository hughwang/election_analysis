I made this post earlier, and edited to add more and more states until I got all of them.

For better visibility, I thought a new thread would do better, here they all are.

Switched votes are votes that were taken from Trump and given to Biden.

Lost votes are voted that disappeared during the counting, from both candidates.

There might be a small overlap between Switched votes and Lost votes.

MEGA BREAKING NEWS EDIT:

I VERIFIED THAT THE SWITCHES ARE REAL!

I went looking through the data I got from my script, trying to find if the moment the Antrim glitch happened in Michigan is there. And it is. Here is the Data.

And here is the specific part when the switch happened.

You can see in that picture, that Trump lost 3,096 votes, those all went to Biden. BUT, Trump also lost 2,324 votes, that went nowhere.

NEW EDIT : Updated the numbers after fixing a small error, MORE states are affected now, holy shit.
